Using the Current Telemetry Setup During Competition
All of Mihir's amazing telemetry code is working with a raspberry pi which acts as a local host so that devices can view the telemetry network easily (connect to our netis wifi router + type in url)

Automatic Startup (Working)
- plug in pi and data will populate after 2 minutes (if the car is on)
- on device, go to http://192.168.1.4:3000/d/Hgs4jSQnz3/daybreak-telemetry?orgId=1&from=now-5m&to=now&refresh=1son


Manual Telemetry Startup
- open terminal (may have to wait up to 30 seconds before ssh)
- command ssh pi@pi.local
- password: raspberry
- command cd /home/pi/Telemetry/link_telemetry && python link_telemetry.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 230400

- go to http://192.168.1.4:3000/d/Hgs4jSQnz3/daybreak-telemetry?orgId=1&from=now-5m&to=now&refresh=1s (or just 192.168.1.5:3000)
- user: admin
- password: new_password


Possible Issues and Fixes
Grafana login not accepted
- user: admin
- password: admin
- reset password to "new_password"

Data not showing
- make sure the timeframe is set on the top right of the dashboard (e.g., 5 minute period + 1 second refresh)

Web server not loading (3 fixes)
1. unplug power from the pi (and wait) then plug back in
2. ssh -> "ip address" -> look for a 192.168.1.X IP address and change the URL for the grafana site to the corresponding IP of the pi
3. Start docker cd /home/pi/Telemetry/link_telemetry && sudo docker compose up then python link_telemetry.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 230400


Notes
Automatic python script is "@reboot sleep 120 && cd /home/pi/Telemetry/link_telemetry && python link_telemetry.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 230400" in the sudo and user (sudo crontab -e AND crontab -e)

Currently messages are not coming in as fast as expected. A suspected issue is that the reception is not completely clean so added characters are changing the message length. This is causing "WARNING: got message length 32, expected 30. Dropping message..."
- Tried running on laptop (docker and script) instead of on the pi
- Tried black antena
-Check: radio module inside the car might be loose

Router wifi password is "password"

Pi is running 64 bit OS to be compatible with influxdb's latest version

The pi should flash a green LED soon after powering on, then it will flicker quickly 2 minutes later to signal it is receiving messages
